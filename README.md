# Background

The fishing industry uses numerous measurements to describe a specific fish.  Our goal is to predict the weight of a fish based on a number of these measurements and determine if any of these measurements are insignificant in determining the weigh of a product.  See below for the description of these measurments.  

## Data Description

The data consists of the following variables:

1. **Weight**: weight of fish in g (numerical)
2. **Species**: species name of fish (categorical)
3. **Body.Height**: height of body of fish in cm (numerical)
4. **Total.Length**: length of fish from mouth to tail in cm (numerical)
5. **Diagonal.Length**: length of diagonal of main body of fish in cm (numerical)
6. **Height**: height of head of fish in cm (numerical)
7. **Width**: width of head of fish in cm (numerical)
